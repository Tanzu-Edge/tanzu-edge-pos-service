# Tanzu Point of Sale backend service

![Alt text](edge-pos-app-arch.jpg?raw=true "POS app architecture")

This service can be started in two modes

1. Sender - exposes a REST API at /v1/api/checkout to receive POS transaction.  The payload gets put on a RabbitMQ queue with a Routing Key based on Store ID.
* set SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=sender
* set POS_STOREID=<something site specific, eg. roswell-east-1234
* this mode is intended to run at each Edge location, with or without a local RabbitMQ instance

2. Receiver - starts as a listener to RabbitMQ for processing POS transactions back in the Datacenter.  Transactions are written to Postgresql
* set SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=receiver
* this mode is intended to run in the Datacenter with Postgresql and RabbitMQ

3. RabbitMQ will be deployed in the remote site and in the datacenter.  We will implement federation as described here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/federated-exchanges.html

# Testing Locally
* docker run -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 --name tanzu-messaging -d bitnami/rabbitmq
* docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=tanzu -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=tanzu-pos -e POSTGRESQL_USERNAME=tanzu -d  --name tanzu-db bitnami/postgresql
* mvn package

# Using Concouse for CI/CD

The pipeline assumes the following:
1. There are 2 separate clusters doing builds and where the app is deployed
2. Concourse is deployed to the same cluster that Tanzu Build Service is deployed to
3. The user has an account/key on Tanzu Network to pull down the RabbitMQ operator and Tanzu SQL operator
4. On the deploy cluster, 2 namespaces have already been created: edge-store and edge-data-services
5. a file params.yaml is created and it's path is set to where this file is located.  see params-example.yaml for and example with comments

Note: After you create 2 kubernetes clusters for build and deploy, grab the kubeconfg values using this command:
    ``` kubectl config view --flatten --minify | yq read - --tojson
    ```
